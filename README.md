This is a small game I made while learning SFML. In it you dodge red squares for as long as you can.

## Gameplay:
- Red squares take hp.
- Hearts give hp.
- Blue Squares give invincibility for a short amount of time

## How to build

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have cmake installed: https://cmake.org/
3. Run the following commands:

```
cmake -B build
camke --build build
```
4. The executable should be inside `build/bin`
